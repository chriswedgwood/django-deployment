today I deployed with fabric and ansible
I have to learn permissions between deployer and root
Issue 1)
The nginx default page would not go away
To fix this you need to remove the default website in /etc/nginx/sites-enabled and /etc/nginx/sites-available

These help
systemctl status nginx.service
sudo tail -F /var/log/nginx/aalondon-error.log 
systemctl start nginx.service
systemctl start nginx.service
nginx -t should produce

"
nginx: the configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful
"

after that I had problems with gunicorn

permissions and path

to diagnose run gunicorn_start manually in the venv to output the error
